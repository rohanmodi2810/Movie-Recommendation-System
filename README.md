# Movie-Recommendation-System
Used the item-based collaborative filtering algorithm for movie recommendation. Developed three models using different approaches - K-Nearest Neighbours, Singular Value Decomposition, Multi-Layer Perceptron using cosine distance as similarity metrics. Models were trained on Movie Lens dataset. All the models performed satisfactorily on the given test dataset.
